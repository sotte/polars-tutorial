# My Small [Polars](https://www.pola.rs/) Tutorial

This is a small polars tutorial.
It covers basic concepts as well as some random (hopefully) useful things.

It is based on the great
[polars cheat sheet](https://franzdiebold.github.io/polars-cheat-sheet/Polars_cheat_sheet.pdf)
but is heavily extended and restructured.

## Getting started

- [polars-tutorial.ipynb](polars-tutorial.ipynb) - rendered notebook
- [polars-tutorial.py](polars-tutorial.py) - notebook in percent format

## Development

```bash
make
```
